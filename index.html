					Introduction

					JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server..

				<p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
					<br> The main pillars of Object Oriented
					Programming are :
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Objects and Classes</li>
					<li>Inheritance</li>
					<li>Polymorphism</li>
					<li>Abstraction</li>

				<p>
					You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name

					Inheritance
				</header>
				<p>
					The capability of a class to derive
					properties and characteristics from
					another class is called Inheritance.
					Inheritance is one of the most important
					feature of Object Oriented Programming.
					Sub Class: The class that inherits
					properties from another class
					is called Sub class or Derived Class.
					Super Class: The class whose properties
					are inherited by sub class is called Base
					Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we
					have to write the functions only one time
					instead of three times as we
					have inherited rest of the three classes
					from base class(Vehicle).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>

					<b>Public Mode : </b>If we derive a sub
					class from a public base class. Then the
					public member of the base class will
					become public in the derived class and
					protected members of the base class
					will become protected in derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a
					sub class from a Protected base class.
					Then both public member and protected
					members of the base class will become
					protected in derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a
					sub class from a Private base class.
					Then both public member and protected
					members of the base class will become
					Private in derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Types of Inheritance in C++ : </b>
					<br><br><br>
					<b>Single Inheritance :</b> In single
					inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit
					from only one class. i.e. one sub class
					is inherited by one base class only.
					<br><br>
					<b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple
					Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a
					class can inherit from more than one
					classes. i.e one sub class is inherited
					from more than one base classes.
					<br><br>
					<b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this
					type of inheritance, a derived class is
					created from another derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Hieratical Inheritance :</b> In this
					type of inheritance, more than one sub
					class is inherited from a single base
					class i.e. more than one derived class
					is created from a single base class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b>
					Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by
					combining more than one type of
					inheritance.
					For example: Combining Hierarchical
					inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

					Polymorphism
				</header>
				<p>
					The word polymorphism means having many
					forms. In simple words, we can define
					polymorphism as the ability of a message
					to be displayed in more than one form.
					A real-life example of polymorphism, a
					person at the same time can have
					different characteristics.
					Like a man at the same time is a father,
					a husband, an employee. So the same
					person posses different behavior in
					different situations. This is called
					polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
					as one of the important features of Object
					Oriented Programming.
					<br>
					<b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly
						divided into two types:</b>
					<br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
					2. Runtime Polymorphism
				</p>

				<p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of
					polymorphism is achieved by function
					overloading or operator overloading.
					<br> Runtime polymorphism: This type
					of polymorphism is achieved by
					Function Overriding.
				</p>

					Abstraction
				</header>

				<p>
					Data abstraction is one of the most
					essential and important feature of object
					oriented programming in C++. Abstraction
					means displaying only essential information
					and hiding the details. Data abstraction
					refers to providing only essential information
					about the data to the outside world,
					hiding the background details or implementation.
					<br> Consider a real life example of a man driving
					a car. The man only knows that pressing the
					accelerators will increase the speed of car
					or applying brakes will stop the car but he
					does not know about how on pressing accelerator
					the speed is actually increasing, he does
					not know about the inner mechanism of the car
					or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
					etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can
					implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.
					Class helps us to group data members and member
					functions using available access specifiers. A
					Class can decide which data member will be
					visible to outside
					world and which is not.
					<br>
					<b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One
					more type of abstraction in C++ can be
					header files. For example, consider the
					pow() method present in math.h header file.
					Whenever we need to calculate power of a
					number, we simply call the
					function pow() present in the math.h header
					file and pass the numbers as arguments
					without knowing the underlying algorithm
					according to which the function is actually
					calculating power of numbers.
					<br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:

					</b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing
					the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code
					duplication and increases reusability.<br>
					3. Can change internal implementation of
					class independently without
					affecting the user.<br> 4. Helps to
					increase security of an application or program
					as only important details are
					provided to the user.

				<header>
					Encapsulation
				</header>
				<p>
					Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatum placeat nobis aut, alias delectus necessitatibus quaerat vel quasi vitae ullam soluta ratione quo non, aspernatur illo harum? Quae, qui dolor!
				</p>

				<p>
					Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
					or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
					the data. In the above example the data of
					any of the section like sales, finance or
					accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>
					In C++ encapsulation
					can be implemented using Class
					and access modifiers.
